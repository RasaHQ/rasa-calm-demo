# Rasa CALM Demo

This demo showcases a chatbot built with Rasa's LLM-native approach: [CALM](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/calm). 

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that the demo bot is an evolving platform. The flows currently 
> implemented in the demo bot are designed to showcase different features and 
> capabilities of the CALM bot. The functionality of each flow may vary, reflecting 
> CALM's current stage of development.

> [!NOTE]
> This demo bot is currently compatible with `3.12.1`.

## Terms of Use

This project is released under the Rasa's [Early Release Software Access Terms](https://rasa.com/early-release-software-terms/). 

## Demo Bot

The demo bot's business logic is implemented as a set of [flows](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/flows), [rules](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/rules), and [stories](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/stories), 
which are organized into three main skill groups: Contacts, Transactions, 
and Others/Misc.

The skill groups `Contacts` and `Transactions` are implemented using CALM, e.g. are defined in flows.
The skill group `Others/Misc` is implemented via the [nlu-based approach](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/training-data-format).
[Coexistence](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/building-assistants/coexistence) allows you to run a single assistant that uses both the Conversational AI with Language Models (CALM) 
approach and an NLU-based system in parallel.

Each flow consists of a `yaml` file and a [domain definition](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/domain), 
which includes [actions](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/domain#actions), 
[slots](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/domain#slots), and 
[bot ressponses](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/domain#responses). 

Additionaly, the bot can showcase the enterprise search capability based on the [SQUAD dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkar/squad).

The table below shows all the skills implemented in the bot:

Rasa ships with a default behavior in CALM for every [conversation repair case](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/conversation-repair/#conversation-repair-cases)
which is handled through a [default pattern flow](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/conversation-repair/#conversation-repair-cases). 
In addition to its core functionality, the demo bot also includes an examples of 
pattern overriding in [`data/flows/patterns.yml`](data/flows/patterns.yml).

## Running the project

This section guides you through the steps to get your Rasa bot up and running. 
We've provided simple `make` commands for a quick setup, as well as the underlying 
Rasa commands for a deeper understanding. Follow these steps to set up the 
environment, train your bot, launch the action server, start interactive sessions, 
and run end-to-end tests.

### Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To build, run, and explore the bot's features, you need Rasa Pro license. You also 
> need access to the `rasa-pro` Python package. For installation instructions
> please refer our documentation [here](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/installation/python/installation).

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to check out the state of the demo bot compatible with Rasa 3.9, please check out the branch
> [3.9.x](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-calm-demo/tree/3.9.x).

Prerequisites:
- rasa pro license
- python (3.10.12), e.g. using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) 
  `pyenv install 3.10.12`
- Some flows require to set up and run [Duckling](https://github.com/facebook/duckling) server
The easiest option is to spin up a docker container using `docker run -p 8000:8000 rasa/duckling`.
Alternatively, you can use the `make run-duckling` command locally.
This runs automatically only when you use the `make run` command, before it launches the Inspector app.

After you cloned the repository, follow these installation steps:

1. Locate to the cloned repo:
   ```
   cd rasa-calm-demo
   ```
2. Set the python environment with `pyenv` or any other tool that gets you the right 
   python version
   ```
   pyenv local 3.10.12
   ```
3. Install the dependencies with `pip`
   ```
   pip install uv
   uv pip install rasa-pro --extra-index-url=https://europe-west3-python.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-pro-python/simple/
   ```
4. Create an environment file `.env` in the root of the project with the following 
   content:
   ```bash
   RASA_PRO_LICENSE=<your rasa pro license key>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openai api key>
   RASA_DUCKLING_HTTP_URL=<url to the duckling server>
   ```

5. If using qdrant for extractive search:
   - Setup a local docker instance of Qdrant
      ```
      docker pull qdrant/qdrant
      docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
         -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
         qdrant/qdrant
      ```
   - Upload data to Qdrant
      - In your virtual environment where Rasa Pro is installed, also install these dependencies:
         ```
         pip install uv
         uv pip install -r qdrant-requirements.txt
         ```
      - Ingest documents from SQUAD dataset (modify the script if qdrant isn't running locally!)
         ```
         python scripts/load-data-to-qdrant.py
         ```
   You can toggle parameter `use_generative_llm` in config.yml to change the behavior. The answer is selected from the first search result -> metadata -> `answer` key

#### Custom Information Retriever

You can use a custom component for Information Retrieval by defining the custom component class name in the config as follows:

```
policies:
- name: FlowPolicy
- name: EnterpriseSearchPolicy
vector_store:
   type: "addons.qdrant.Qdrant_Store"
```

This configuration refers to `addons/qdrant.py` file and the class `Qdrant_Store`. This class is also an example that information retrievers can use a custom query, note that in `search()` function the query is rewritten using the chat transcript by `prepare_search_query` function.

### Configuration

Check `config/config.yml` to make sure the configuration is appropriate before you train and run the bot.
There are some alternative configurations available in the config folder. 
Theses can be used via the appropriate `make` command during training.

### Training the bot

To train a model use `make` command for simplicity:
```commandline
make rasa-train
```
which is a shortcut for:
```commandline
rasa train -c config/config.yml -d domain --data data
```

Alternative configurations can be accessed for Multistep command generation:
```commandline
make rasa-train-multistep
```
or for Enterprise search with qdrant for extractive search:
```commandline
make rasa-train-qdrant
```



The trained model is stored in `models` directory located in the project root.

### Starting the assistant

Before interacting with your assistant, start the action server to enable the 
assistant to perform custom actions located in the `actions` directory. Start the 
action server with the `make` command:
```commandline
make rasa-actions
```
which is a shortcut for:
```commandline
rasa run actions
```

Once the action server is started, you have two options to interact with your trained
assistant:

1. **GUI-based interaction** using rasa inspector:
```commandline
rasa inspect --debug
```

2. **CLI-based interaction** using rasa shell:
```commandline
rasa shell --debug
```

### Running e2e tests

The demo bot comes with a set of e2e tests, categorized into two primary groups: 
**failing**, and **passing**. These tests are organized not per individual flow but 
according to CALM functionalities.

> [!NOTE]
> The passing and failing statuses are relative to the performance of the GPT-4, 
> which is enabled by default. The use of different models may yield varying results. 

You have the flexibility to run either all tests, only the passing tests, only the 
failing tests, or a single specific test.

------

To run **all the tests** you can use the `make` command:
```commandline
make rasa-test
```
or
```commandline
rasa test e2e e2e_tests
```

------

To run **passing/failing/flaky** tests you can use the `make` command:
```commandline
make rasa-test-passing
```
```commandline
make rasa-test-failing
```
```commandline
make rasa-test-flaky
```
or
```commandline
run rasa test e2e e2e_tests/passing
```
```commandline
run rasa test e2e e2e_tests/failing
```
```commandline
run rasa test e2e e2e_tests/flaky
```

------

To run a **single test** with `make` command, you need to provide the path to a 
target test in an environment variable `target`:
```commandline
export target=e2e_tests/path/to/a/target/test.yml
```
and then run:
```commandline
make rasa-test-one
```
or
```commandline
rasa test e2e e2e/tests/path/to/a/target/test.yml
```

------

To run only the tests which are relevant to multistep command generation, 
you can use the make command:

```commandline
make rasa-test-multistep
```
or
```commandline
run rasa test e2e e2e_tests/multistep
```

#### E2E tests with assertions
To enable the feature, please set the environment variable `RASA_PRO_BETA_E2E_ASSERTIONS` to true in your testing environment.

`export RASA_PRO_BETA_E2E_ASSERTIONS=true`

To run **all the tests**:

```commandline
rasa test e2e e2e_tests_with_assertions
```

------

To run **passing/failing/flaky** tests:
```commandline
rasa test e2e e2e_tests_with_assertions/passing
```
```commandline
rasa test e2e e2e_tests_with_assertions/failing
```
```commandline
rasa test e2e e2e_tests_with_assertions/flaky
```

------

To run a **single test** , provide the path to a 
target test:

```commandline
rasa test e2e e2e_tests_with_assertions/tests/path/to/a/target/test.yml
```

------

### Enable `Open Telemetry` tracing and metrics
1. Uncomment (and update if required) the `tracing` and `metrics` blocks in the
[`endpoints.yml`](./endpoints.yml) file.
2. _If_ intending to export traces and metrics to monitoring backend `Honeycomb` cloud for visualisation, then set API key `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`.
    - If intending to send to a different monitoring backend, then update [`otel-collector-config.yml`](./otel-collector-config.yml) and [`otel-docker-compose.yml`](./otel-docker-compose.yml) files accordingly, and set required API key(s) if required.
3. To enable mapping traces or metrics to corresponding `rasa-pro` version, `rasa-calm-demo` git repository branch and commit hash, set `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
via `` `make set-otel-resource-attributes` `` (note the backticks in the command. Those are to be included, and _not_ to be omitted).
    - If intending to set other attributes also, such as git tag etc, then set `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` 
    manually: `export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=key1=value,key2=value2,key-n=value-n`
4. Start OTEL collector as a `docker` container (named `otel-collector`): `make run-otel-collector`
    - **Optional**: A health check on the collector can be performed via `make otel-collector-health-check` (Note: `curl` and `jq` utilities required for this)
5. Train and use Rasa bot assistant.
6. View traces and metrics: Now generated traces and metrics would be visible in:
    - `Honeycomb`'s web UI (or other chosen monitoring backend, if using a different one).
    - Also in `otel-collector`'s console logs. To troubleshoot in case traces or metrics do not appear on the monitoring backend, start by checking these logs via:
        - `make print-otel-collector-logs`

#### E2E tests for Repeat Command
To enable the feature, please set the environment variable `RASA_PRO_BETA_REPEAT_COMMAND` to true in your testing environment.

```
make test-repeat-command
```

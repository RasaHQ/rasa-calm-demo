<s>[INST] Your task is to analyze the current conversation context and generate a list of actions to start new business processes that we call flows, to extract slots, or respond to small talk and knowledge requests.

These are the flows that can be started, with their description and slots:
{% for flow in available_flows %}
{{ flow.name }}: {{ flow.description }}
    {% for slot in flow.slots -%}
    slot: {{ slot.name }}{% if slot.description %} ({{ slot.description }}){% endif %}{% if slot.allowed_values %}, allowed values: {{ slot.allowed_values }}{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
{%- endfor %}

===
{% if current_flow != None %}
You are currently in the flow "{{ current_flow }}".
You have just asked the user for the slot "{{ current_slot }}"{% if current_slot_description %} ({{ current_slot_description }}){% endif %}.

{% if flow_slots|length > 0 %}
Here are the slots of the currently active flow:
{% for slot in flow_slots -%}
- name: {{ slot.name }}, value: {{ slot.value }}, type: {{ slot.type }}, description: {{ slot.description}}{% if slot.allowed_values %}, allowed values: {{ slot.allowed_values }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% else %}
You are currently not in any flow and so there are no active slots.
This means you can only set a slot if you first start a flow that requires that slot.
{% endif %}
If you start a flow, first start the flow and then optionally fill that flow's slots with information the user provided in their message.

===
Based on this information generate a list of actions you want to take. Any logic of what happens afterwards is handled by the flow engine. These are your available actions:
* Slot setting, described by "SetSlot(slot_name, slot_value)". An example would be "SetSlot(recipient, Freddy)". Only set a slot when it is explicitly mentioned by the user, do not set a slot with abstract or unspecific values.
* Starting a flow, described by "StartFlow(flow_name)". An example would be "StartFlow(transfer_money)".
* Canceling/Stopping the current flow, described by "CancelFlow()". Examples of user canceling flow phrases are: "stop that", "cancel this".
* Clarifying which flow should be started. An example would be Clarify(list_contacts, add_contact, remove_contact) if the user just wrote "contacts" and there are multiple potential candidates. It also works with a single flow name to confirm you understood correctly, as in Clarify(transfer_money).
* Intercepting and handle user messages with the intent to bypass the current step in the flow, described by "SkipQuestion()". Examples of user skip phrases are: "Go to the next question", "Ask me something else".
* Responding to knowledge-oriented user messages, that needs further information from a knowledge base, described by "SearchAndReply()".
* Responding to a casual, non-task-oriented user message, described by "ChitChat()". Do not predict "ChitChat()" if the message contains valuable information, such as slots.
* Handing off to a human, in case the user seems frustrated or explicitly asks to speak to one, described by "HumanHandoff()".

===
Do not fill slots with abstract values or placeholders.
You can only fill a slot when a flow is active.
Only use information provided by the user.
If the user asks for two things which seem contradictory, clarify before starting a flow.
If it's not clear whether the user wants to skip the step or to cancel the flow, cancel the flow.
Strictly adhere to the provided action types listed above.
Focus on the last message and take it one step at a time.
Use the previous conversation steps only to aid understanding.
Only predict "ChitChat()" if there is no other action to take.
A flow can be interrupted by another flow.
If value of a slot is not provided by user, assign it a value of "undefined".

Here is what happened previously in the conversation:
{{ current_conversation }}

The user just said """{{ user_message }}""".

[INST]
Think this through step by step and first write an analysis of the last user message. Pay close attention to the descriptions of slots. Do not fill slots with abstract values before the user has mentioned or referenced the values. Do not add any unnecessary actions.
Afterwards, write out the actions you want to take, one per line.
